ðŸš€ Cloud DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline Using AWS

This project showcases a production-grade **CI/CD pipeline** using **AWS CodePipeline**, **CodeBuild**, and **Amazon ECR** to securely build and deploy a Dockerized Python application. It follows DevSecOps principles, automating every step from source to container image delivery.


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Language**: Python (Flask)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD Tools**: AWS CodePipeline & CodeBuild
- **Artifact Registry**: Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform
- **Security**: Trivy vulnerability scanning (optional)
- **Version Control**: GitHub

ðŸ”„ CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

1. **GitHub Push**: Triggers CodePipeline
2. **CodeBuild Stage**:
   - Builds Docker image
   - Tags image with commit ID
   - Pushes image to Amazon ECR
3. **Completion**: On success, image is ready for deployment
